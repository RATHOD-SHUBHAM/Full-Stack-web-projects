## 2] Whatsapp:
      Have you ever been in a situation where you wanted to send message/document to someone on WhatsApp and did not want save their contact??????
      By default WhatsApp does not allow you to do that. 
      So i tought why not build a webapp that allows you to smoothly slide into whatsapp without and send messages or documents wihtout having to save their number into your contact.
      >> Just type in the number , smash send button and boom you are into whatsapp/
